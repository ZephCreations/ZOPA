# ZOPA

_by Zeph Hardie and Andrew Gibson_

This is the ZOPA project repo
## Aim
This project Aims to help people organise and schedule their time. 
Designed to organise tasks to be completed into pre-determined 
time slots, by their priority and the user's estimated time to be completed. 
This program will automatically adjust the schedule when changes are made
so that tasks are still scheduled to be completed.
